Problem:
A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.

Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

Algorithm:
Two loops to generate all products of two 3-digit numbers, each product result is converter to string to check
if the first char and last char match using a for loop. Each iteration of the for loop shrinks the substring and if it reaches 
the middle we have found a palindrome.  Then check it against the largest palindrome found so far.
